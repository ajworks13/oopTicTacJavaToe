# oopTicTacJavaToe
trying to make the game in oop form instead this time around.


NOTES:
Last thing I did was print the array list with spaces in between.
Gotta give them an error check.
Gotta somehow make showBoard not refresh all the time.
Maybe use a recursive method to handle the gameboard!
9/4/22 - Found out that showBoard is not updating and is just printing as a new print without a previous change.
    Can not update showBoard at all when calling it from the main class. And when calling it from the gameboard class, it updates 1 time each time but without the previous result.
